/*This is a hangman game I created with the help of the Javascript for Kids book. It starts by creating a function which picks a random word from the array created. 
Then it creates a variable which helps the player by keeping track of how many letters are left to be guessed. It then asks for the player's input, which has to be a single character long.
Whenever the player guesses a letter right, it replaces "-" with the letter guessed. When all of the letters are guessed, the web page will congratulate the player. 
In case the player wants to quit the game, he/she can easily do so by clicking the cancel button when it asks for a input*/
